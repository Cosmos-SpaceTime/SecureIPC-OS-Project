# 🛡 SecureIPC-Framework

A **high-performance, secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework** for Windows OS, built on a **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) architecture**. This project focuses on **asynchronous messaging, message security, and efficient process communication**, ensuring **scalability and tamper-proof data exchange**.

---

## 🚀 Why Secure IPC?
Traditional IPC mechanisms lack **robust security** and **scalability**, making them vulnerable to **data interception and tampering**. SecureIPC-Framework solves this by integrating **encryption, access control, and health monitoring**, making it ideal for **enterprise applications, microservices, and real-time systems**.

---

## 🔹 Features

✔ **Pub-Sub Architecture** – Decouples publishers and subscribers for flexible, event-driven messaging.
✔ **Message Broker** – Centralized topic registry and efficient message routing.
✔ **Multi-Threaded Processing** – Optimized with thread pools for parallel execution.
✔ **Message Prioritization** – Ensures high-priority messages are delivered first.
✔ **Heartbeat Monitoring** – Detects inactive publishers/subscribers for system health tracking.
✔ **End-to-End Encryption** – AES-256 encryption to protect data in transit and at rest.
✔ **Authentication & Access Control** – Implements Windows ACLs and identity verification.
✔ **Dynamic Scaling** – Auto-adjusts system resources based on workload.
