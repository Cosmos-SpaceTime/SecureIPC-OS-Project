# 📌 TLV (Type-Length-Value) Format Explained

## 🔍 What is TLV?

**Type-Length-Value (TLV)** is a **data encoding format** used in many communication protocols, including **networking, security, and messaging systems**. It is a structured way of encoding **variable-length data** where each piece of information is represented as:

- **Type (T):** Defines what kind of data is being transmitted (e.g., integer, string, binary, etc.).
- **Length (L):** Specifies the size of the value field.
- **Value (V):** The actual data being transmitted.

### 📚 Standard TLV Reference

TLV is widely used in **telecommunications (GSM SIM data), financial systems (EMV chip cards), and network protocols**. A detailed reference on TLV can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value).

## 🛠 How TLV Works in Our Pub/Sub System

In our **Secure IPC Pub/Sub framework**, TLV is used to **structure messages exchanged between publishers, subscribers, and the broker**. This helps ensure:

✅ **Efficient message parsing** - The receiver can extract data dynamically.
✅ **Flexibility** - Supports variable-length messages without a fixed format.
✅ **Scalability** - Easily extends to new message types.

### 🚀 TLV Working in Our Implementation

Our TLV system follows these principles:

1. **Message Construction:** Each message is formatted as `T-L-V` triplets.
2. **Insertion of TLVs:** Data is added using `tlv_buffer_insert_tlv()`.
3. **Retrieval of TLVs:** Messages are parsed using `tlv_buffer_get_particular_tlv()`.
4. **Iteration Over TLVs:** Using `ITERATE_TLV_BEGIN` and `ITERATE_TLV_END`, we can extract all TLVs from a buffer.

## 📌 Example TLV Message

Here’s an example of how a TLV-encoded message might look in binary format:

```
0x01 0x05  "Hello"   # Type: 1, Length: 5, Value: "Hello"
0x02 0x03  "123"     # Type: 2, Length: 3, Value: "123"
```

This structure ensures **consistent, fast, and reliable communication** in our Pub/Sub system. 🔥

## 🔒 Why TLV for Security?

Using TLV encoding enhances security by:

- **Preventing malformed messages** through strict type validation.
- **Ensuring data integrity** by defining fixed-length structures.
- **Facilitating encryption** at the `Value` level without breaking the format.

🚀 TLV **standardizes** our messaging structure, making our Secure IPC Pub/Sub system **robust, scalable, and secure**! 🔐
